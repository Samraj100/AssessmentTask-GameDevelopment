# Identifying and Defining

# PMI

## Rocket League

Plus: Heavily relies on hand-eye coordination, and provides a chellenge for people trying to progress higher in the game. It also requires teamwork and communication for a better chance at progression. 

Minus: The skill ceiling may be too high and a lot of people might struggle or try too hard to be as good as they want, which may result in addiction. 

Interesting: It is a unique game which introduces a combination of soccer and driving. 


## Minecraft 

Plus: A relaxing game which develops basic motor skills like hand to eye coordination. It allows for creative outside of the box thinking to survive and progress through the game.

Minus: Addiction, and it is an online game that may lead to cyber bullying.

Interesting: It contains different game modes like creative and survival, where people can focus on achieving a goal with their own environment. 

## Tetris

Plus: Strategic game which requires a lot of thinking to succeed and progress higher. 

Minus: The game gets inreasingly difficult and is very hard to master. It can cause people to get unmotivated and bored of the game quickly. 

Interesting: Quite a simple game with easy to understand mechanics, uncluding very few controls.


Need: To improve hand to eye coordination and and patience for children which allows for creativity and problem solving skills useful in the real world. 

Problem statement: It is helpful for young children to get engaged in games which provide insight and educate them in real world situations. Using a 2d game to visualise these ideas will be effective for people to use different strategies to progress through the game

Skill development: To develop the skills to make my game, I will use learn.unity for tutorials and explanations. 

# Requirements outline:

**Inputs:**
Directional keys will control movement in basic directions. Mouse/touchpad will control the direction the character will face. Extra keys will control any additional abilities or interactions.

**Processing:** 
Game will update the score in response to a specific goal that has been reached, which will be reset if any collisions are detected. The program will also update the position of the player. 

**Outputs:** 
Game will display the character position and score, in addition to sound effects based on the user's actions.

**Transmission:** 
My project does not require any data transmissions.

**Storage:**
The game will store the user's high score locally as well as any customised settings.

# Functional Requirements
**User Interaction:** The user will interact with the game through keyboard inputs. The provided inputs will manage movement of a character, any selected options, and additional abilities. W, A, S and D will control basic movements. Space will control extra inputs required by the game such as settings or exiting. Moving the mouse or touchpad will change the direction the character wil face for aiming. 

**Core Gameplay or Simulation Mechanics:** The player will need to control a character that moves in basic directions in order to dodge obstacles. The game will also allow users to toggle between different power-ups that will be collected in the game. Some power-ups like shooters will be aimed by the player to destroy incoming obstacles for a better chance of survival. 

**Scoring and Feedback:** There will be a progress tracking system which will track how long the player will survive without colliding with any obstacles. There will be a scoring system based on how many seconds the player will survive. 

**Level Progression or Simulation Stages:** The player will advance through the game by unlocking new levels. This is done by completing a specific taks like surviving a certain amount of time. 

**Saving and Loading Data:** Data will be stored locally on the device that is being used. The progress will be saved and will load everytime the game starts. Game might give an option to save to cloud.

# Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Requirements:** Since the game is saved locally, it doesn't need internet and will load is a reasonable amount of time (3-5 seconds). There shouldn't be any latency issues, and the game graphics will not be too high quality so there will be little to no delay. 

**Usability Requirements:** The game will include instructions which the user can view any time they want, as well as an on screen prompt that flashes onto the screen for a few seconds after playing the game. 

**Compatability Requirements:** The game must be compatible with PC, using the keyboard and touchpad/mouse.

**Scalability Requirements:** The game should be able to scale to add more levels and features that may increase personalisation. 

# Consideration of Social and Ethical Issues

**Equity:** The quality of being fair to everyone by valuing their own needs, in order for an equal outcome.\
**Accessability:** Being able to be used or reached by others.

## Accessability

My project should be usable for people of all abilities. Since the game requires a lot of hand-eye coordination, some people would progress and process information quicker than others. To combat this there would be some settings which allow players to customize sensitivity, controls and visuals. Some in-game assistance will also be implemented, and this would include some form of instructions or prompts which would help the player get used to the controls. 

## Privacy and Data Protection

My project won't collect any sensitive data, but it will store high scores and achievements. To increase security, the game will autosave locally so there will be no risk of data breaches. In addition, the game gives an option to save progress to the cloud as a way to access the game in multiple places while still offering security. 

## Fairness and Representation

My project will establish no form of harmful stereotypes, and it will not connect with any violations that may affect a person's opinion on the game. It will avoid unnecessary bias due to the fact that the characters will not be human - instead it will use objects like UFOs and vehicles to represent the player. 

## Mental and Emotional Wellbeing

My game will imply difficult gameplay but it shouldn't affect the user's mental health negatively while playing. The game will require a lot of hand-eye coordination so it may be difficult to get the hang of, but it is not necessarily fast paced and it will feel rewarding when completing echievements. 

## Cultural Sensitivities

The content in this game should not be offensive to other cultures. It is very unlikely to be the case, since the game will incoorporate levels which are only reflective of the natural world. It also shouldn't be misunderstood, as certain levels will retain their specific theme like 'space' or 'the ocean'.
